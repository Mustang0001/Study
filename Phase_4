Excellent — Phase 4 is where you move from “good at DSA” to “interview-ready engineer.”
These are non-linear data structures that Fortune 500 companies love to test.

Below is the COMPLETE, EXHAUSTIVE, NO-GAP list of ALL topics & sub-topics we will cover in
🔵 PHASE 4 — NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES

> Duration: ~6 weeks
Goal: Master Trees, Heaps, Tries & advanced techniques used in interviews

✅ PHASE 4 COMPLETION CRITERIA

You move forward only if you can: ✔ Traverse trees confidently
✔ Solve LCA without memorizing
✔ Use heaps for priority problems
✔ Implement trie from scratch
✔ Explain tree recursion clearly


---

🧠 WHY PHASE 4 MATTERS

If Phase 4 is weak:

Medium → Hard problems feel impossible


If Phase 4 is strong:

Interviewers see engineering maturity

Confidence skyrockets ✨⭐

Advanced topics feel logical
