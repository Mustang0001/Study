✅ PHASE 6 COMPLETION CRITERIA

You move forward only if you can: ✔ Design DP states yourself
✔ Convert recursion to DP
✔ Optimize space confidently
✔ Solve medium DP without hints
✔ Explain recurrence clearly

If DP is weak:

Hard problems feel impossible


If DP is strong:

Hard problems become structured ✨⭐

Interviewers immediately respect you
