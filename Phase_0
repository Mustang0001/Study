Perfect — Phase 0 is the foundation that makes everything else easy.
Below is the EXHAUSTIVE, NO-GAP list of ALL topics & subtopics we will cover in PHASE 0 before touching Python or DSA.

This phase is language-agnostic and focuses on how computers + algorithms actually work.


---

🔵 PHASE 0 — COMPUTER SCIENCE FOUNDATIONS (COMPLETE LIST)

> Duration: 5–7 days
Goal: Think like an engineer, not a syntax learner




---

1️⃣ What is Computer Science?

What problems computers solve

Difference between:

Computer Science

Programming

Software Engineering


Algorithm vs Program

Why DSA exists

Why Fortune 500 interviews focus on DSA



---

2️⃣ What is an Algorithm? (VERY DEEP)

Definition of an algorithm

Characteristics:

Input

Output

Definiteness

Finiteness

Effectiveness


Deterministic vs Non-deterministic algorithms

Recursive vs Iterative algorithms

Correctness vs Efficiency

Real-world algorithm examples



---

3️⃣ What is a Data Structure?

Definition

Why data structures are needed

Data organization vs data storage

Abstract Data Types (ADT)

Logical vs Physical data structures

Static vs Dynamic structures

Linear vs Non-linear structures

Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous data



---

4️⃣ Levels of Programming Languages

Machine language

Assembly language

High-level languages

Compiled vs Interpreted languages

Where Python fits

How Python executes code internally



---

5️⃣ How a Program Executes (INSIDE THE SYSTEM)

Source code → Execution

Interpreter lifecycle

Parsing

Bytecode generation

Python Virtual Machine (PVM)

Execution stack



---

6️⃣ Memory Fundamentals (CRITICAL)

What is memory?

RAM vs ROM

Stack memory

Heap memory

Call stack

Stack frame

Function calls in memory

Garbage collection (conceptual)



---

7️⃣ Bits, Bytes & Binary World

What is a bit?

What is a byte?

Binary number system

Decimal → Binary conversion

Binary → Decimal conversion

Why computers use binary

Signed vs unsigned numbers

Overflow & underflow



---

8️⃣ Data Representation

Integer representation

Floating-point representation (basic IEEE idea)

Character encoding

ASCII

Unicode (UTF-8 overview)

Boolean representation



---

9️⃣ Flow of Control (Logic Building)

Sequential execution

Conditional execution

Iterative execution

Nested logic

Flowcharts

Pseudocode writing



---

🔟 Problem-Solving Methodology (MOST IMPORTANT)

Understanding the problem statement

Identifying inputs & outputs

Constraints analysis

Edge case identification

Brute force approach

Optimized approach thinking

Trade-offs

Writing clear logic before coding



---

1️⃣1️⃣ Introduction to Complexity

Why performance matters

What is time complexity?

What is space complexity?

Growth of functions

Constant vs linear vs quadratic

Why Big-O exists (intuition only)



---

1️⃣2️⃣ Common Beginner Pitfalls

Why code fails

Logical errors vs syntax errors

Runtime errors

Infinite loops

Stack overflow

Off-by-one errors



---

1️⃣3️⃣ Engineering Mindset

Writing readable code

Naming conventions

Consistency

Debugging mindset

Thinking in steps

Learning discipline



---

✅ PHASE 0 COMPLETION CRITERIA

You are ready to move forward when you can: ✔ Explain stack vs heap
✔ Convert decimal ↔ binary
✔ Write pseudocode for a problem
✔ Estimate basic complexity
✔ Dry-run logic confidently


---

🧠 WHY THIS MATTERS

Most people jump straight to coding and struggle.

After Phase 0:

Python will feel easy

DSA will feel logical

Interviews will feel structured
